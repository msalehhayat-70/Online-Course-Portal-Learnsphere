- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Admin  
  - Student
- Course creation and management (Admin)
- Course enrollment (Student)
- Course progress tracking
- File upload and data management
- Cloud deployment
- Logging, monitoring, and analytics
- RESTful API architecture
- Secure and validated data handling

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a scalable backend using **FastAPI**
- Integrate **MongoDB** for flexible data storage
