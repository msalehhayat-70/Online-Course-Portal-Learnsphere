# Online Course Portal (OCP) – Backend System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Online Course Portal (OCP)** is a RESTful backend system developed using **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**.  
The project focuses on building a **fast, scalable, and secure backend** capable of handling user authentication, data management, and file uploads.

This backend system is designed to be easily integrated with **web and mobile frontend applications**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and implement a RESTful backend using **FastAPI**
- Integrate **MongoDB** for flexible and scalable data storage
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms
- Provide file upload and management functionality
- Ensure high performance, scalability, and maintainability

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Many traditional backend systems:
- Have slow response times  
- Are difficult to scale  
- Lack proper data validation and security  
- Require complex configurations  

There is a need for a lightweight, fast, and scalable backend system that can efficiently manage users, data, and file handling while remaining easy to integrate with frontend applications.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
OCP is a backend-only system that:
- Uses **FastAPI** for high-performance API development
- Uses **MongoDB** as a NoSQL database for flexible data storage
- Supports authentication, CRUD operations, and file uploads
- Communicates with clients using **JSON-based REST APIs**

---

## 🧩 Scope of the Project
### Included
- Backend API development  
- Database integration and management  
- Authentication handling  
- File upload functionality  

### Not Included

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a **Client–Server Architecture**:

1. Client sends HTTP requests  
2. FastAPI processes requests  
3. MongoDB handles database operations  
4. Responses are returned in JSON format  

This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

---

## 🔄 Methodology
The project follows a modular and incremental development approach:

1. Requirement analysis  
2. System design  
3. Database design  
4. API development  
5. Testing and validation  
6. Documentation  

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes
- Fully functional backend system  
- Secure and validated APIs  
- Efficient database operations  
- File upload and management support  
- Ready for frontend or mobile application integration  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No frontend interface  
- Basic authentication  
- Limited role management  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- JWT-based authentication  
- Role-based access control  
- Frontend integration  
- Cloud deployment  
- Logging and monitoring
